# Amazon_Sales_Analysis

**Overview:**
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of Amazon sales data to uncover key insights on product performance, shipping efficiency, and customer preferences. The analysis aimed to improve inventory management and enhance delivery operations.


**Description:**
The project involved exploring and analyzing an Amazon sales dataset containing information about product categories, shipping statuses, and product sizes. Using data analytics and visualization techniques, patterns in sales performance and customer behavior were identified to support strategic business decisions.


**Objectives:**

* Identify top-performing product categories and sizes.
* Evaluate shipping performance and customer return/cancellation behavior.
* Provide actionable insights for inventory and logistics optimization.

**Key Findings & Insights:**

* **Top Categories:** T-shirts and Shirts accounted for the majority of total sales.
* **Size Demand:** Sizes **M, L, XL, and XXL** were the most preferred by customers.
* **Delivery Performance:**

  * **Successful Deliveries:** 77.43%
  * **Cancellations:** 13.82%
  * **Returns:** 5.25%
* **Business Insight:** High-performing categories align with consistent size demand, indicating potential for inventory scaling. However, notable cancellations and returns suggest a need for deeper analysis into fulfillment and quality factors.


**Recommendations:**

* Prioritize stock levels for high-demand products and popular sizes.
* Enhance delivery operations to minimize pending or lost shipments.
* Implement customer feedback loops to reduce cancellations and returns.
* Develop promotional strategies for underperforming categories.


**Tools & Techniques Used:**

* **Tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook, MS Excel
* **Techniques:** Data cleaning, visualization, and descriptive analytics


**Conclusion:**
This project successfully identified key sales drivers and logistical inefficiencies within the dataset. Implementing the insights can lead to improved customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and optimized inventory management.
